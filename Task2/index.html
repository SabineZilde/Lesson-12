        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Only drug dealers and software companies call their customers 'users'</li>
                <li>Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.</li>
                <li>Good design is a lot like clear thinking made visual.</li>
                <li>Design cannot rescue failed content.</li>
                <li>The essential test of design is how well it assists the understanding of the content, not how stylish it is.</li>
                <li>If the statistics are boring, you've got the wrong numbers.</li>
                <li>Design isn't crafting a beautiful, textured button with breathtaking animation. It's figuring out if there's a way to get rid of the button altogether.</li>
                <li>It is not how much empty space there is, but rather how it is used. It is not how much information there is, but rather how effectively it is arranged.</li>
                <li>It is straightforward for me to be ethical, responsible, and kind-hearted because I have the resources to support that.</li>
                <li class="special-quote">Above all else show the data.</li>
            </ol>
