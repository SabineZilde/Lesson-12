            <p class="dark"><strong>The Beach</strong> is a 2000 adventure drama film directed by Danny Boyle and based
                on the 1996 novel
                of the same name by Alex Garland, which was adapted for the film by John Hodge. The film stars Leonardo
                DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet, and Robert Carlyle. It was filmed on the
                Thai island of Ko Phi Phi Le. </p>
            <p class="light">The film was a moderate box office success but received mixed-to-negative reviews from
                critics. DiCaprio was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor (lost to John Travolta as
                Terl from Battlefield Earth and as Russ Richards in Lucky Numbers). In spite of that, All Saints's song
                "Pure Shores" topped the UK charts. </p>

                settled there in secret.</p>
            <p class="dark">Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces Françoise and
